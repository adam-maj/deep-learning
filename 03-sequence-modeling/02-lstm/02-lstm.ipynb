In this setup, weight values $w_{ij} > 1$ will quickly get magnified to massive values, and $w_{ij} < 1$ will quickly vanish to 0.\n","\n","To avoid this, we'd ideally like to propagate information through time via linear mapping, which would allow us to backpropagate gradients far back in time without the magnifying effects of multiplying by weights.\n","\n","This motivates the idea of a \"constant error carousel\" (CEC), which can just be thought of as a linear unit across time, ie. activation function $f(x) = x$, and weight $w = 1$). Such a linear unit would be able to store some value and then propagate it forward in time.\n","\n","However, some initial issues emerge that block it from functioning as we want.\n","\n","Ideally, we want to be able to store some value in this CEC, which would require the weight $w = 1$, and then be able to persist that value for a long time and prevent it from being affected with $w = 0$. Similarly, the information in the CEC may remain irrelevant for a long time, so we may want the activation to map the output to $0$ for a long time until the value within the CEC becomes useful, where the activation can map it to the identity.\n","\n","These two goals motivate the idea of gates in the LSTM. The LSTM uses an \"input gate\" to determine when to store information with a linear pathway (like the CEC), and an \"output gate\" to determine when to release information from it.\n","\n","By enabling the network to store and release information with this linear pathway, gradients can be backpropagated far back in time without any magnification by weights, meaning relationships can be formed between data points far apart in time.\n","\n","### Math\n","\n","Specifically, we define the linear long-term error pathway $s_c$\n","\n","$$ s_{c_j}(0) = 0 \\\\ s_{c_j}(t) = s_{c_j}(t - 1) + y^{\\textrm{in}_j}(t)g(\\textrm{net}_{c_j}(t))$$\n","\n","This defines the \"input gate\" that controls the information that gets stored with the linear pathway.\n","\n","By default, the long-term pathway stores just persists its value from the previous time step (a memory) via $s_{c_j}(t) = s_{c_j}(t - 1)$.\n","\n","Additionally, at each time-step it adds the product of the activation of the current cells input (which can be thought of as the \"value\" of what to remember) with the weighted sum of other cells activations from the previous time-step (which can be thought of as the \"relevance\" of the value to the long-term memory).\n","\n","The output gate similarly is calculated as:\n","\n","$$y^{c_j}(t) = y^{\\textrm{out}_j}(t)h(s_{c_j}(t))$$\n","\n","Which multiplies the current linear long-term memory pathway value (which corresponds with the \"value\" of the memory beings stored) with the output gate value (which corresponds with the \"relevance\" of the stored long-term memory to the current time-step).\n","\n","With these two gates, the LSTM is able to backpropagate gradients conditionally across long time-ranges.\n","\n","In terms of backpropagation, the output gate can be thought of as trapping error in the CEC pathway to be sent far back in time to relevant time-steps, and the input gate as releasing this error to be back-propagated to the memory cells in time-steps relevant to the computation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Yro4z42ir8eW"},"source":["# My Notes\n","\n","## 📜 [Long Short-Term Memory](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F23/document/readings/LSTM.pdf)\n","\n","> Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error back-flow.\n","\n","> [We] address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM).\n","\n","> LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1).\n","\n","> In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.\n","\n","> LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.\n","\n","LSTM is a far more efficient and effective learning algorithm than all previous approaches to RNNs.\n","\n","> In principle, recurrent networks can use their feedback connections to store representations of recent input events in the form of activations (short-term memory, as opposed to long-term memory embodied by slowly changing weights).\n","\n","> With conventional backpropagation through time (BPTT) or real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), error signals flowing backward in time tend to (1) blow up or (2) vanish; the temporal evolution of the back-propagated error exponentially depends on the size of the weights.\n","\n","The central problem - gradients explode or vanish as they get back-propagated through time because the same weights are contributing multiple times to the output through each time-step.\n","\n","> This article presents long short-term memory (LSTM), a novel recurrent network architecture in conjunction with an appropriate gradient-based learning algorithm.\n","\n","> LSTM is designed to overcome these error back-flow problems.\n","\n","The LSTM is an architecture built specifically to fix the gradient back-flow errors (vanish/exploding gradients) faced by previous RNN architectures.\n","\n","> It can learn to bridge time intervals in excess of 1000 steps even in case of noisy, incompressible input sequences, without loss of short-time-lag capabilities.\n","\n","### Previous Work\n","\n","This section is a good indicator of how much work happens at the frontiers of research and on problems before a correct and effective solution is discovered.

Memory Cells and Gate Units**\n","\n","In order to construct an architecture that allows for constant error flow, while mitigating the errors discussed above, the CEC is extended with additional features.\n","\n","> A multiplicative input gate unit is introduced to protect the memory contents stored in $j$ from perturbation by irrelevant inputs, and a multiplicative output gate unit is introduced to protect other units from perturbation by currently irrelevant memory contents stored in $j$.\n","\n","> The resulting, more complex unit is called a memory cell.\n","\n","> Each memory cell is built around a central linear unit with a fixed self-connection.\n","\n","This linear unit represents the CEC which persists the cell state (long-term memory).\n","\n","![Screenshot 2024-05-14 at 2.26.28 PM.png](../../images/Screenshot_2024-05-14_at_2.26.28_PM.png)\n","\n","Here, most importantly, we have the linear long-term error pathway through the middle with the recurrence, where we have\n","\n","$$\n","s_{c_j}(0) = 0 \\\\\n","s_{c_j}(t) = s_{c_j}(t-1) + y^{\\textrm{in}_j}(t)g(\\textrm{net}_{c_j}(t))\n","$$\n","\n","Indicating that the linear CEC pathway is just the sum of it’s value in the previous time-step, plus the value computed by the multiple of the activation of the current cells input, and the activation of the previous cells output (short-term memory).\n","\n","Intuitively, the activation of the cells input can be thought of as the “value” to add to long-term memory, and the activation of the previous cell (short-term memory) can be thought of as multiplying by it’s “relevance” to determine how much to add to the long-term memory pathway.\n","\n","Similarly, the output can be calculated as\n","\n","$$\n","y^{c_j}(t) = y^{\\textrm{out}_j}(t)h(s_{c_j}(t))\n","$$\n","\n","Which can be thought of as the multiple of the output gate activation to this cell which is the “relevance” of the long-term memory in this case, as well as the actual activation on the current long-term memory pathway, which is the “value” of long-term memory to pull from as the output of this cell.\n","\n","In-terms of actual weight and bias connections to other cells, there are a few relevant distinctions.\n","\n","First, the actual “input” value to the cell, contributing the input gate is a function of the weights and outputs of other cells (coming from their short-term memory outputs) in the previous time-step.\n","\n","$$\n","y^{\\textrm{in}_j}(t) = f_{\\textrm{in}_j}(\\textrm{net}_{\\textrm{in}_j}(t)) \\\\\n","\\textrm{net}_{\\textrm{in}_j} = \\sum_u w_{\\textrm{in}_ju}y^u(t-1)\n","$$\n","\n","And similarly, the actual “output” value contributing to the “relevance” of the long-term memory pathway for the cell is influenced by the weights and outputs of other cells in the previous time-step\n","\n","$$\n","y^{\\textrm{out}_j}(t) = f_{\\textrm{out}_j}(\\textrm{net}_{\\textrm{out}_j}(t)) \\\\\n","\\textrm{net}_{\\textrm{out}_j} = \\sum_u w_{\\textrm{out}_ju}y^u(t-1)\n","$$\n","\n","And finally, that the actual previous short-term memory coming from this cell specifically in the previous time step is considered via\n","\n","$$\n","\\textrm{net}_{c_j}(t) = \\sum_u w_{c_ju} y^u (t-1)\n","$$\n","\n","**2. Why Gate Units?**\n","\n","> In other words, the net can use $\\textrm{in}_j$ to decide when to keep or override information in memory cell $c_j$ and $\\textrm{out}_j$ to decide when to access memory cell $c_j$ and when to prevent other units from being perturbed by $c_j$.\n","\n","> Error signals trapped within a memory cell’s CEC cannot change, but\n","> different error signals flowing into the cell (at different times) via its output gate may get superimposed.\n","\n","Sometime’s the error signal at the most recent time-step will suggest that the CEC should have held an increased memory value, sometimes decreased. These will be different at different time-steps.\n","\n","The gate values are what determines how much different time-steps should affect the gates of an individual cell, and how much the gradients should be back-propagated in time.\n","\n","For example, a single cell may only be active given the presence of a specific type of concept, and hold memory about that concept in context - then in periods where the concept is presented, the in gate is turned on, then when it needs to be used as context, the output gate’s are on.\n","\n","Hence, only in these type steps where the input or output gates should be active are the gradients from the CEC back-propagated through to actually update the weights from this cell, otherwise the gates close out the gradients.\n","\n","> The output gate will have to learn which errors to trap in its CEC by appropriately scaling them.\n","\n","When an error is particularly relevant to a cell, the output gate needs to be scaling the CEC pathway to have a high impact on the cells output.\n","\n","In reverse, this means that the gradient will be back-propagated through the CEC pathway since it had a high influence, allowing previous time-steps to get the error.\n","\n","So in the context of back-propagation, the output gate can be thought of as “trapping” the error within the CEC pathway _only_ when the error is one relevant to the learned function of a cell.\n","\n","> The input gate will have to learn when to release errors, again by appropriately scaling them.\n","\n","Conversely, the input gate captures the errors coming through the CEC pathway (as trapped by an output cell in the current or later time-step), and “releases” the errors to be back-propagated through the parameters of the cell, only when relevant (when there is something important to contribute to the long-term memory pathway).\n","\n","> Essentially the multiplicative gate units open and close access to constant error flow through CEC.\n","\n","This is the core intuition behind the gates of the LSTMs, and is critical.

Memory Cell Blocks**\n","\n","> S memory cells sharing the same input gate and the same output gate form a structure called a memory cell block of size S.

Learning**\n","\n","> To ensure non-decaying error backpropagation through internal states of memory cells, as with truncated BPTT, errors arriving at memory cell net inputs do not get propagated back further in time (although they do serve to change the incoming weights).\n","\n","This answer my question about how the same vanishing/exploding gradients don’t get back-propagated through time just like in RNNs.
