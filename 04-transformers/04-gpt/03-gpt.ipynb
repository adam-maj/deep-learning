This motivates exploring additional setups for performing multitask learning.\n","\n","Multitask learning is promising for approaching general intelligence in language models, but it is expensive to create labeled datasets for it.\n","\n","> We demonstrate language models can perform down-stream tasks in a zero-shot setting – without any parameter or architecture modification.\n","\n","### Approach\n","\n","> Language modeling is also able to, in principle, learn the tasks of without the need for explicit supervision of which symbols are the outputs to be predicted.\n","\n","> The internet contains a vast amount of information that is passively available without the need for interactive communication. Our speculation is that a language model with sufficient capacity will begin to learn to infer and perform the tasks demonstrated in natural language sequences in order to better predict them, regardless of their method of procurement.\n","\n","Here’s the hypothesis of OpenAI that leads to all their scaling laws research. The intuition is that the internet already has a ton of data and that providing the model with this data will make it learn more than people expect.\n","\n","**1.
